# Description of the project

This is a simple project that involves interacting and conversing with two floating heads. The left controller interacts with the left floating head, and the right controller interacts with the right floating head. The conversation with one head cannot be interupted until the end, and then the player can interact with the other.

# Instructions for use

The left and right controllers' grip buttons select the corresponding head and starts its dialogue. The controllers' trigger buttons continue the conversation taking place from the selected head.

# How it works

How the project works is, the player can interact with each one of the two heads, one at a time.

What I am most proud of in the assignment was

# What I learned

I learned how to use ProBuilder for the first time to construct the giant floating heads, one piece at a time. I have also learned how to use LeanTween to make transitions for the dialogue from each head.

##### Headings

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
