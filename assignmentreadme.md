# Description of the project

This is a simple project that involves interacting and conversing with two floating heads. The left controller interacts with the left floating head, and the right controller interacts with the right floating head. The conversation with one head cannot be interupted until the end, and then the player can interact with the other.

# Instructions for use

The left and right controllers' grip buttons select the corresponding head and starts its dialogue. The controllers' trigger buttons continue the conversation taking place from the selected head.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
